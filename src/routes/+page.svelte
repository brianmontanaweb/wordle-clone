<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the Wordle Clone</h1>

<ol>
	<li>You have six tries to guess the five-letter Wordle of the day.</li>
	<li>
		Type in your guess and submit your word by hitting the “enter” key on your keyboard.
	</li>
	<li>
		The color of the tiles will change after you submit your word. A yellow tile indicates that you
		picked the right letter but it’s in the wrong spot. The green tile indicates that you picked the
		right letter in the correct spot. The gray tile indicates that the letter you picked is not
		included in the word at all.
	</li>
	<li>Continue until you solve the Wordle or run out of guesses. Good luck!</li>
</ol>
