# Wordle Mock

This uses Svelte and json-server for a mock API. This doesn't use a BE mock API, I want to be a straight forward and simple.

## Getting started

- Run `nvm use` for the correct node version
- Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies based on the package-lock manifest
- Run `npm start` and navigate to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
